## I. Introduction to COAFI

The Cosmic Omnidevelopable Aero Foresights Index (COAFI) is a documentation framework designed specifically for the GAIA AIR project. It provides a structured, consistent, and scalable way to organize and manage the vast amount of technical information associated with this complex project. The framework is designed to support *living documentation*, adapting and evolving alongside the project itself. This Master Index, as indicated by the "Draft" status and date in the document header, will be regularly updated to reflect the latest revisions and project documentation structure.

**Purpose of COAFI:**

*   To manage the inherent complexity of the GAIA AIR project documentation.
*   To ensure consistency in documentation style, format, and referencing across all systems and components.
*   To facilitate seamless collaboration and information sharing among diverse engineering and operational teams.
*   To enable efficient searching, retrieval, and contextualization of technical information for various user roles.
*   To rigorously support regulatory compliance and airworthiness/spaceworthiness certification processes.
*   To provide end-to-end traceability and audit trails from high-level system requirements down to detailed component design and implementation specifics.
*   To establish a **contextualized** documentation approach where data is presented with appropriate processing and filtering for specific user needs.
*   To facilitate **circular** documentation processes, allowing for iterative refinement and continuous improvement based on feedback and operational experience.

**Benefits of COAFI:**

*   **Modularity:** Documentation is broken down into independent modules (Parts, Chapters, Documents), enabling focused updates and improvements without impacting the entire framework.
*   **Scalability:** The hierarchical and coded structure is designed to accommodate the continuous growth and expansion of the GAIA AIR project documentation as new systems and technologies are integrated.
*   **Flexibility:** The framework is adaptable and can be modified to incorporate changes in project scope, technology advancements, and evolving documentation requirements.
*   **Enhanced Discoverability:** Facilitates efficient information retrieval through optimized navigation and search functionalities (planned GAIA Quantum Portal integration).
*   **Contextualization:** The "Views" system (planned for future implementation) allows for tailoring documentation presentation to specific user roles, ensuring users access only the most relevant information for their tasks.

**Relationship to ATA Chapters:** COAFI Part I (Airframes) and Part II (Spaceframes) are aligned with the Air Transport Association (ATA) chapter system and Air Transport Association Space (AS) chapter system respectively. This alignment ensures compatibility with industry-standard documentation practices while extending beyond traditional ATA to encompass the unique aspects of GAIA AIR, including quantum technologies, AI, and space operations.

**For a complete overview of the COAFI structure, see [COAFI Structure and Guidelines](Part0/GP-OV-COAFI-0001-A.md).**

## III. COAFI Documentation Structure

The COAFI documentation system is organized using a hierarchical structure, designed for modularity, scalability, and ease of navigation. The hierarchy consists of the following levels:

*   **Master Index:** The top-level entry point for the entire COAFI documentation set, providing a comprehensive table of contents and links to all Parts, Sections, and key documents (this document - `COAFI.MD`).
*   **Parts:** Major divisions representing distinct domains or aspects of the GAIA AIR project. COAFI is currently divided into Parts 0 through IX, each focusing on a specific area (e.g., Airframes, Spaceframes, Propulsion, Project Management).
*   **Sections (Optional):** Subdivisions within Parts, used for logical grouping of related chapters or documents within a Part. Sections are used as needed to further organize content within larger Parts.
*   **Chapters:** Within each Part (or Section), content is further divided into Chapters, which represent specific systems, subsystems, or functional areas. Part I and Part II utilize an adapted ATA/AS chapter numbering system (00-99, 00-100) for detailed system documentation.
*   **Documents:** The fundamental units of COAFI documentation. Each chapter is composed of individual Markdown files (`.md`) that contain specific information, specifications, procedures, analyses, or reports related to a particular topic within the COAFI framework.

Each document within the COAFI framework is assigned a unique and structured document code to facilitate organization, identification, and cross-referencing. The document code follows a standardized format:

`[Part Code]-[System Code]-[Subsystem Code]-[Assembly Code]-[Disassembly Code]-[Disassy Code Variant]-[Info Code]-[Info Code Variant]-[Item Location Code]`

| Code Component         | Description                                                                    | Example          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Part Code**         | Identifies the main project area (Part I, Part II, etc.)                         | GP-OV, GP-AM      |
| **System Code**        | Identifies the major system or domain (Airframe, Propulsion, Avionics, etc.)    | GAI, AMPEL, HEUR    |
| **Subsystem Code (Opt)**| Identifies a specific subsystem within a system (optional, used for granularity)| QEE, SSS, IAH     |
| **Assembly Code**       | Numeric code identifying a major assembly or module.                             | 0100, 0200        |
| **Disassembly Code**    | Numeric code identifying a sub-assembly or component within an assembly.       | 001, 005          |
| **Disassembly Code Variant**| Alphanumeric character indicating a variant or revision of a sub-assembly. | A, B, Q01         |
| **Info Code**           | Identifies the type of information contained in the document (Overview, Specification, Procedure, etc.). | OV, SP, DS        |
| **Info Code Variant**   | Alphanumeric character indicating a variant or revision of the information type.| A, B, THEO       |
| **Item Location Code**  | Numeric code indicating the physical location or zone within the aircraft or spaceframe (often "00" for general documents). | 00, FUS, CAB      |

**Refer to [COAFI System and Subsystem Codes (Part0/GP-OV-NUM-0004-001-A.md)](Part0/GP-OV-NUM-0004-001-A.md) for a complete and detailed list of all System Codes, Subsystem Codes, and their corresponding descriptions used within the COAFI framework.**

## V. COAFI Views

COAFI supports the concept of "Views," which are designed to tailor the presentation and accessibility of documentation based on specific user roles and needs. This ensures that users can efficiently access and navigate the information most relevant to their responsibilities.  **COAFI Views Implementation:** The implementation of COAFI Views is a planned feature. It is envisioned to leverage technologies such as MkDocs plugins, custom JavaScript, and potentially integration with the GAIA Quantum Portal (GQP) to provide role-based access and dynamic content filtering, tailoring the documentation presentation to specific user needs.

*   **Engineer View:**  Specifications, designs, test procedures, and results.
*   **Regulatory View:**  Certification documents, safety analyses, and compliance reports.
*   **Project Manager View:**  Project schedules, requirements, progress reports, and risk assessments.
*   **Maintenance View:**  Maintenance procedures, parts lists, and troubleshooting guides.
*   **Executive View:**  High-level overviews, key performance indicators, and strategic summaries.

**For more information on COAFI Views and their implementation roadmap, see [COAFI Views Implementation Guide](Part0/views_guide.md).**
