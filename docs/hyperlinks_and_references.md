## Introduction

Hyperlinks and references enhance user experience by providing easy access to relevant documentation. This document covers the hyperlinks and references added to the code, including internal links, external links, and anchor links.

## Hyperlinks and References Overview

The following types of hyperlinks and references have been added to the code:
- Internal Links
- External Links
- Anchor Links

## Using Hyperlinks and References

### Internal Links

Internal links are used to navigate within the same document or to other documents within the same repository. To use an internal link, follow these steps:
1. Identify the target document or section within the same repository.
2. Create a hyperlink using the relative path to the target document or section.
3. Ensure that the link text is descriptive and indicates the purpose of the link.

Example:
```markdown
[Interactive Elements Documentation](docs/interactive_elements.md)
```

### External Links

External links are used to navigate to resources outside the repository. To use an external link, follow these steps:
1. Identify the target URL of the external resource.
2. Create a hyperlink using the full URL of the target resource.
3. Ensure that the link text is descriptive and indicates the purpose of the link.

Example:
```markdown
[Inquirer.js Documentation](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js)
```

### Anchor Links

Anchor links are used to navigate to specific sections within the same document. To use an anchor link, follow these steps:
1. Identify the target section within the same document.
2. Create a hyperlink using the anchor link format (`#section-name`).
3. Ensure that the link text is descriptive and indicates the purpose of the link.

Example:
```markdown
