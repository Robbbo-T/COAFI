## Introduction

Interactive elements enhance user experience by providing dynamic and responsive features. This document covers the interactive elements added to the code, including buttons, forms, and command-line interfaces.

## Interactive Elements Overview

The following interactive elements have been added to the code:
- Buttons
- Forms
- Command-Line Interfaces

## Using Interactive Elements

### Buttons

Buttons are used to trigger actions or events. To use a button, follow these steps:
1. Locate the button element in the code.
2. Add an `onClick` event handler to define the action to be performed when the button is clicked.
3. Style the button using CSS to match the desired appearance.

Example:
```html
<button onClick="handleButtonClick()">Click Me</button>
```

### Forms

Forms are used to collect user input. To use a form, follow these steps:
1. Create a form element in the code.
2. Add input fields, labels, and submit buttons as needed.
3. Add an `onSubmit` event handler to define the action to be performed when the form is submitted.
4. Style the form using CSS to match the desired appearance.

Example:
```html
<form onSubmit="handleSubmit(event)">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

### Command-Line Interfaces

Command-line interfaces (CLIs) allow users to interact with the code through the terminal. To use a CLI, follow these steps:
1. Install the necessary CLI library (e.g., Inquirer.js, Commander.js).
2. Define the CLI commands and options in the code.
3. Implement the logic for each command.
4. Run the CLI from the terminal.

Example (using Inquirer.js):
```javascript
const inquirer = require('inquirer');

inquirer.prompt([
  {
    type: 'input',
    name: 'username',
    message: 'What is your name?',
  },
]).then(answers => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${answers.username}!`);
});
```
